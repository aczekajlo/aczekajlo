Hello ðŸ™‚

My name is Agatha and I'm a geospatial scientist currently working in the elementsLab, in the School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada).

I am an R enthusiast - learning through practice!

My current interests include urban forestry, urban planning & design, and land use/cover.
