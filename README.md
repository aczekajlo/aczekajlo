Hello ğŸ™‚

My name is Agatha and I'm trained geospatial scientist, currently working as a policy and planning analyst in regional government (Metro Vancouver, Canada).

I'm an R enthusiast - learning through practice!

My current interests include urban forestry, urban planning & design, housing, and land use/cover change.
