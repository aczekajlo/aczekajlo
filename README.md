Hello 🙂

My name is Agatha and I'm trained geospatial scientist, with experience using R, Google Earth Engine (JavaScript), and Python to analyze Landsat, Sentinel, and ALS (lidar).

My work bridges spatial analysis, technical writing, and project management to deliver accurate, well-communicated solutions for urban and environmental challenges.
